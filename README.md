# Odin Project Assignment: Hashmap

This repository holds my practice in implementing a hashmap data structure using vanilla JavaScript (Node).

For complete details of the exercise, please see [Project: HashMap](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-hashmap), which forms part of The Odin Project's "[Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)" course.
